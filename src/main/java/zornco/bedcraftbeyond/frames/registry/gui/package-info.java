// TODO: PACKETS
// Need to make packets to and from server to sync these changes to the server registry
// and the other clients as changes are made. In theory, the registry can be synced on server start,
// but it would be better to have a directory for each server for this purpose so we don't need to sync that
// and clog up the network stream.
